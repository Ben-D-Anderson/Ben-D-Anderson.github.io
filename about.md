Hello, my name is Ben Anderson. I'm a software engineer and cyber security enthusiast from the United Kingdom.

This is my personal blog where I write about programming and cyber security. This includes topics in said fields which I find particulary interesting or want to share - including my own mini-projects.

With regards to programming, I'm most experienced in Java and am an Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 8 Programmer. The majority of my programming projects will either be in Java or Python, as I have a fair amount of experience with Python too.

The content and opinions on this blog are completely my own and do not represent any entity or organisation that I work for.
