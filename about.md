Hello, my name is Ben Anderson. I'm a programmer and cyber security enthusiast from the UK.

This is my personal blog where I write about programming and cyber security. This includes topics in said fields which I find particulary interesting or want to share - including my own mini-projects.

With regards to programming, I'm most experienced in Java and am an Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 8 Programmer. The majority of my programming projects will either be in Java or Python, as I have a fair amount of experience with Python too. You'll likely find that many of my posts include some sort of moral perspective, as I consider myself an advocate for online privacy.

The content and opinions on this blog are completely my own and do not represent any entity or organisation that I work for.
