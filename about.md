Hello, my name is Ben Anderson. I'm a programmer and cyber security enthusiast from England.

This is my personal blog where I write about topics surrounding programming and cyber security. I use this blog to write about anything in said fields which I find particulary interesting or want to share - including my own mini-projects.

With regards to programming, I'm most experienced in Java so the majority of my programming projects will either be Java or Python. You'll also likely find that many of my blog posts include some sort of moral perspective, as I consider myself an advocate for online privacy.

The content and opinions on this blog are completely my own and do not represent any entity or organisation that I work for.
